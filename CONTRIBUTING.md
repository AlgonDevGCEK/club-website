# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the College Club Website 

This project is maintained by the ***ALGON DC Technical team*** and is intended for collaborative academic development. To keep the codebase clean, stable, and easy to manage, please follow the guidelines below.



## 📌 General Rules

- **Do NOT push directly to the `main` branch**
- All work must be done on a feature branch
- Always discuss changes with the team before starting major work
- Keep commits clean, meaningful, and well-documented
- Respect deadlines and academic integrity


## 🌱 Branching Strategy

### Main Branch
- `main` is the stable production branch
- Only reviewed and approved code will be merged into `main`

### Feature Branches
- Create a new branch for every feature or fix
- **Branch naming convention:**
feature/
fix/
docs/
**Examples:**
- `feature/events-page`
- `feature/login-system`
- `fix/navbar-alignment`
- `docs/contributing-guidelines`


## 🛠️ How to Contribute

git pull origin main
```
### Step 2: Create a Feature Branch

```
### Step 3: Make Changes
-  Write clean and readable code
-  Follow existing project structure
-  Comment where necessary

### Step 4: Commit Changes
